# AAA (Anti-Aircraft Artillery) 

AAA is a two player game in which each player defends their area of air space by shooting down enemy airplanes using their anti-aircraft guns. I worked on this individual project in the Programming-1 curriculum at FIEA, UCF. The instructions for this project were to make a game using the provided OpenGL framework.

I implemented managers to handle physics (collision) update and game object update. The colliders support collider tags in order to prevent friendly fire, etc. and call methods on game objects which can be implemented on coding custom game objects.

## How to play:

- Open **OpenGL Framework.sln** file and run the project.
- Use **A** and **D** to rotate the turret on German side. And **W** to fire. (Player 1)
- Use **4** and **6** on the numpad to rotate the turret on the British side. And **8** on the numpad to fire. (Player 2)
- Press **R** to restart the game whenever anyone loses.

## Additional Information:

- **Release 1 - OpenGL_Framework** - The framework provided by the professor for the individual project.
- **Release 2 - AAA_-_Final_Game** - The game in its final state.
